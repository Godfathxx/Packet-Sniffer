# Packet-Sniffer
This repository contains a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets in real time. The tool is designed to monitor network traffic, identify potential security issues, and gather data for network analysis.

Overview
A packet sniffer is a network monitoring tool that captures data packets transmitted over a network. This project enables users to analyze these packets to understand network behavior, troubleshoot issues, and detect anomalies.

Features
Packet Capture: Capture packets from the network interface.
Packet Analysis: Analyze and display packet details such as source and destination IP, protocol, and payload.
Real-Time Monitoring: Monitor network traffic in real time.
Custom Filters: Apply filters to capture specific types of traffic.
Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
Scapy (for packet capturing and analysis)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/packet-sniffer.git
cd packet-sniffer
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install scapy
Running the Packet Sniffer
1. Start Packet Capturing
Run the following command to start capturing packets from the default network interface:

go
Copy code
```bash
python sniffer.py
```
By default, this will capture packets and display their details in the console.

2. Capture Packets with Custom Filters
To apply custom filters and capture specific types of packets, modify the sniffer.py script or pass filter parameters as command-line arguments if supported.

3. Analyze Captured Packets
The tool will display packet details such as:

Source IP address
Destination IP address
Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)
Payload data
Review the captured packets to analyze network traffic.

Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Import Scapy for packet capturing
from scapy.all import sniff

# Define a callback function to process captured packets
def packet_callback(packet):
    print(packet.show())

# Start packet sniffing on the default network interface
sniff(prn=packet_callback, store=0)
